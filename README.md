# Popcorn.js Boilerplate

This is the simplest imaginable collection of files needed to get started with [Popcorn.js](http://popcornjs.org).

## Who is this for?

- Beginner coders who want to learn to write Popcorn plugins and build interactive videos
- Advanced coders who like to do everything from scratch, except a few repetitive bits

## What's included

- A boilerplate index.html file with room for a style sheet and references to the minimal necessary scripts
- A blank script.js file. This is where you put your page logic
- The latest *release* version of [Popcorn.js](https://github.com/mozilla/popcorn-js)
- A few plugin boilerplate scripts. Use these as a starting point to write your Popcorn plugins ([popcorn.baseTemplate.js](https://github.com/brianchirls/popcorn-boilerplate/blob/master/js/plugins/popcorn.baseTemplate.js) is my favorite)
- [popcorn-base](https://github.com/brianchirls/popcorn-base) - a plugin wrapper designed to make
it much, much easier to write great plugins

## Examples

One very simple example is included that uses the very basic Words plugin. Words is
intended as an example of how to build a simple, flexible and reusable Popcorn plugin.
